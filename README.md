# British Airline - Data Science 

# Project Description

During this project, I perform crawling data from different sources using BeautifulSoup (BS4) module.
Then clean, analyze data to obtain valuable insights and give recommendations to have more customers.
Finally, I create a predective model for the data. 

# How to Install and Run the Project:

The project needs to have some libraries: seaborn, skrlearn, matplotlib, bs4, pandas, etc. 
Using command: pip install <name> to install

# Key findings overview:

When analyzing the file, I find:
• The number of customers who are solo travelers are larger than traveling in groups.
• The 7-9 am flight are the most often booked when comparing to others.
-> We can offer more flights depart between 7-9am. Or at noon.
• Usually, customers do not want preferred seat
-> We can offer promotion for people to increase chance of buying seat.
• Usually, customers booking is not completed. (0 means False, 1 means True)
-> Could be because of website feature, difficult to complete the booking? -> We can offer more user-friendly, easy to book feature.
